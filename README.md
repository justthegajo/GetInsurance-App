# GetInsurance-App

This assignment is related with the workshop Git and GitHub Fundamentals and the goal is to have some new insights about those tools and to get a grip about the process.

The first objective is to create a python script with functions like `add_policy()`, `remove_policy()`, and `list_policies()` for an Insurance company.
